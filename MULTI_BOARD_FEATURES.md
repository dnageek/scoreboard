# 🎯 Multi-Board Features

## New in v2.0.0: Multi-Board Support!

The Score Board application now supports managing multiple boards simultaneously! This major update allows you to:

### ✨ Key Features

1. **Multiple Board Access**
   - Log into multiple boards at the same time
   - Switch between boards using intuitive tabs
   - Each board maintains its own data independently

2. **Enhanced UI**
   - Board tabs with visual status indicators
   - Quick board switching without losing context
   - Add new boards without logging out

3. **Smart Data Management**
   - Automatic state persistence across browser sessions
   - Independent sync status for each board
   - Legacy single-board support for migration

### 🚀 How to Use Multi-Board

#### Adding Boards
1. **From Login Page**: Use the traditional login method to add your first board
2. **From Board Page**: Click the "Add Board" button to access existing or create new boards
3. **Quick Access**: Use the modal to switch between creating new boards or accessing existing ones

#### Managing Boards
- **Switch Boards**: Click any tab to switch to that board
- **Close Boards**: Click the × button on any tab to close that board
- **Visual Status**: Color-coded status indicators show sync status
  - 🟢 Green: Successfully synced
  - 🟡 Yellow: Currently syncing
  - 🔴 Red: Sync error

#### Board Independence
- Each board maintains separate:
  - Score values
  - Custom reasons
  - History entries
  - Statistics data

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Data Structure
```javascript
// Multi-board state management
boards: Map<boardId, BoardData>
activeBoardId: string
```

#### Compatibility

- **Session Persistence**: Board state survives browser restarts

### 🎨 UI Enhancements

- **Add Board Modal**: Quick access to create/access boards
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time sync status for each board

#### Updated Styling

- No data loss during the transition

#### Breaking Changes
- None! All existing functionality is preserved
- New features are additive and optional

### 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Memory Usage**: Multiple boards increase browser memory usage
2. **Network**: Each board syncs independently (may increase network traffic)
3. **Mobile UX**: Tab scrolling on smaller screens (addressed with responsive design)

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
